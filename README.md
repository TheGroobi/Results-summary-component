## My process
    First I wanted to align the component using flexbox, but it kept breaking so i had to look for other solutions. I ended up aligning it with grid and setting fixed widths, which i know is not ideal, but i couldn't get anything else to work.
    The rest was pretty easy, just some issues with margins/padding and media queries for mobile. Also i forgot to use :nth-of-child selectors which made my life a pain near the end but, i'm already too deep and don't wanna think about fixing it rn i might do it later/some day.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

The main thing i learnt was using grid, which i was ignoring for a long time. I feel like this project was meant to be built with grid, so that's what i did. I also revised how to effectively use media queries. The rest i pretty much already knew and just used my previous knowledge.
### Continued development

Still need to use more display: grid; to get a better hang of it. Not used to it at all. 

### Useful resources

- [Gradient](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/gradient/linear-gradient) - Self explanatory guide for linear gradient needed in this challenge.
- [Notes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Comments) - Forgot how to make notes, found this very useful. 
- [Grid](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/tryit.php?filename=trycss_grid-column) - Help me fix some issues with grid.
- [Media Queries](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_mediaqueries.asp) - Really helped me understand media queries, and figure out how to align items with grid on a mobile width.
- [Different Colored Elements](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69465622/hello-how-can-i-put-different-colors-in-a-p-element) - I forgot that :nth-of-child selector existed so i used spans, like in this Stack Overflow question. It's not the best solution, but i guess it works for now.
